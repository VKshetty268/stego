1. Use of Service

Stego provides tools to scan and analyze image files for potential threats or anomalies.

3. File Uploads

You may upload supported image files (e.g., PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP) for scanning.

You agree not to upload files that contain illegal, harmful, or copyrighted content without authorization.

Uploaded files are scanned and temporarily processed. They are not shared with third parties except as necessary to provide the service.

4. Results and Accuracy

Stego provides detection results (e.g., safe, malicious, suspicious) based on automated analysis.

While we strive for accuracy, results are not guaranteed and should not replace professional security practices.

By using the service, you consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

7. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or misuse the service.

Upon termination, your access to scans and account data may be revoked.
